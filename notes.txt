    That folder contains a short talk I gave on Numba at the end of a seminar, and
    also a much expanded talk Travis gave that incorporates some of slides from my
    talke with others he had

    As for a case study, you should ask @Oscar to give you some examples from the
    Praxes x-ray crystallography project.

    One of the larger ones was using rewriting Newton's method into Numba so we
    could inline a user function and compile the whole thing.

    The original code used a generic solver from scipy that had to call back into
    Python for every evaluation of the objective function.

LLVM optimizations
------------------

inlining
loop unrolling
vectorizing

funny: sum(0...n) => n(n-1)/2

Install
-------

conda

(otherwise: build LLVM and llvmlite)


Benchmarks
----------

CPython: 11.9
Numba: 0.093 -> 130x faster

Mandelbrot (10 iters):

CPython: 3.74  -> 1x
Numpy: 0.2     -> 19x
Numba (CPU): 0.031   -> 120x
Numba (GPU): 0.010   -> 370x

Mandelbrot (20 iters):

CPython: 4.98  -> 1x
Numpy: 0.40     -> 12x     <-- FP overflows
Numba (CPU): 0.046   -> 110x
Numba (GPU): 0.014   -> 355x

(GPU is a 70â‚¬ GT 730)
